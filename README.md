# Analyzing ARP Traffic In Wireshark

This lab focuses on capturing and analyzing Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) data using Wireshark, a powerful network protocol analyzer.
ARP is used in TCP/IP networks to map layer 3 IPv4 addresses to layer 2 MAC addresses. By understanding ARP messages and analyzing them, one can troubleshoot network connectivity issues and gain insights into the device communication on a local network.
